#look up "gitignore"
#might need to learn more about UNIX, perhaps take a course in it.

#unix commmands:
  #pwd - present working directory
  #mkdir - make directory; adds to the present directory
  #rmdir - remove directory; dir must be empty
  #rm - removes non-empty dir; is permenant
  #cd - changes directory; starts from present directory; cd alone will bring you back to home dir
  #ls - LS lists the directory content
    #note that pressing tab will autocomplete a dir if that is the only start, e.g. D tab will bring up Desktop
  #cd .. - parent directory; e.g. cd .. moves to parent dir
  #cd . - current directory; wont change directories
  #cd ~ - returns to home dir; e.g. cd ~ moves to home dir
  #cd - - returns to previous dir
  #mv - is a move command; note that there is no confirmation
      #can also rename e.g. cd ../file.text ../other.text
  #cp - similar to move, but copies instead
  #less - look at the file; type q to exit less
